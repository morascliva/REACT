function exampleScope() {
  if (true) {
    var varScoped = "I am var"; // Function-scoped with hoisting
    let letScoped = "I am let"; // Block-scoped
  }

  console.log(varScoped); // Outputs "I am var"
  // console.log(letScoped); // Throws an error: "ReferenceError: letScoped is not defined"
}

exampleScope();




In this example:

varScoped is declared using var inside the if block. It's function-scoped and gets hoisted to the top of the function. 
This means it can be accessed from anywhere within the function, regardless of its actual declaration position.

letScoped is declared using let inside the same if block. It's block-scoped, which means it's only accessible within the block where it's defined.
It's not hoisted to the top of the block, and trying to access it outside of the block will result in a "ReferenceError."

When we attempt to log varScoped outside of the block, it works without any issues and outputs "I am var."

If we try to log letScoped outside of the block, it will result in a "ReferenceError" because it's not accessible in the outer scope.

This demonstrates how var variables are function-scoped and can be accessed even before their declaration (due to hoisting), whereas let variables are block-scoped and
are not hoisted in a way that would allow access before their declaration. Using let can help prevent accidental variable access and promote more predictable behavior in your code.
