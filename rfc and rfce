In the context of React, "RFC" stands for "React Function Component," and "RFC-E" stands for "React Function Component with Effects."
  These terms are often used informally to describe different ways of writing components in React, particularly when dealing with functional components and their associated effects 
(such as state updates and side effects).

RFC - React Function Component:
A React Function Component (RFC) is a way of defining a component using a JavaScript function. It's the basic building block of modern React applications and is a simpler and more concise alternative to using
class components. RFCs typically accept props as their input and return JSX (React elements) that describe the component's user interface.



import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = (props) => {
  return <div>Hello, {props.name}!</div>;
};

export default MyComponent;



RFC-E - React Function Component with Effects:
RFC-E, or React Function Component with Effects, extends the concept of an RFC by incorporating the management of side effects and component state using React Hooks.
Hooks like useState, useEffect, and others allow functional components to manage state and perform side effects without the need for class components.




import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
  }, [count]);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;



Difference between RFC and RFC-E:
The key difference between RFC and RFC-E is that RFC-E components utilize React Hooks to manage state and perform side effects, while RFC components are simple function components without the hooks. 
  RFC-E components provide a more modern and efficient way to handle complex component logic, as hooks make it easier to work with state and effects without the need for class components and lifecycle methods.

In summary, RFC is a basic React Function Component, while RFC-E is an extension that incorporates the use of React Hooks for managing state and side effects.
