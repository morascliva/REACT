<h3 style={{color:"white",backgroundColor:"gray"}}>hii there</h3><br/>


<h3 style={{color:"white",backgroundColor:"gray"}}>hii there</h3>:

This is an HTML line that creates a level 3 heading (<h3>).
The style attribute is used to apply inline CSS styles to the heading element.
In the style attribute, color:"white" sets the text color to white.
backgroundColor:"gray" sets the background color of the heading to gray.
The content of the heading is "hii there".








<br/>:

This is an HTML self-closing tag that represents a line break.
It creates a visual break in the content, moving the subsequent content to the next line.
So, the entire code creates a white text on a gray background level 3 heading saying "hii there", and then adds a line break after it.

Please note that the usage of inline styles like this is not the best practice for styling in modern web development.
It's more common to use external CSS files or internal <style> blocks in the <head> of the HTML document to separate the styling from the content.
