In React, the types of CSS you can use are similar to standard CSS used in web development. However, React introduces some specific conventions and techniques for applying styles due to its 
component-based architecture and the use of JavaScript. Here are the common ways to handle CSS in React:






Inline Styles:

Similar to inline styles in regular HTML, you can apply inline styles in React components using JSX.
Styles are defined as JavaScript objects where keys are CSS properties in camelCase and values are the property values.
Example:

const componentStyle = {
  color: 'blue',
  fontSize: '16px',
};

function MyComponent() {
  return <div style={componentStyle}>This is a blue text.</div>;
}











CSS Modules:

CSS Modules allow you to scope CSS styles to specific React components by generating unique class names.
CSS files are imported as modules, and the styles are accessed through properties of the imported module.
This helps avoid global style conflicts.
Example:

CSS Modules:

import styles from './MyComponent.module.css';

function MyComponent() {
  return <div className={styles.myComponent}>Styled using CSS Modules</div>;
}











Styled Components:

Styled Components is a popular third-party library that allows you to define component styles using tagged template literals.
Styles are written directly in your React components and are scoped to those components.
Example:

import styled from 'styled-components';

const StyledDiv = styled.div`
  color: red;
  font-size: 18px;
`;

function MyComponent() {
  return <StyledDiv>This text is styled using Styled Components.</StyledDiv>;
}








Emotion:

Emotion is another CSS-in-JS library that offers similar features to Styled Components.
It provides powerful styling capabilities, theming, and responsive design.
Example:

import { css } from '@emotion/react';

const dynamicColor = 'green';

const dynamicStyle = css`
  color: ${dynamicColor};
  font-size: 16px;
`;

function MyComponent() {
  return <div css={dynamicStyle}>This text has a dynamic color.</div>;
}








Radium:

Radium is a CSS-in-JS library specifically designed for React that allows you to apply inline styles with additional features like media queries and pseudo-classes.
It extends the capabilities of inline styles in a React-friendly way.
Example:

import Radium from 'radium';

const styles = {
  base: {
    color: 'purple',
    fontSize: '20px',
    ':hover': {
      color: 'blue',
    },
  },
};

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div style={styles.base}>Hover over me for a color change.</div>
);

export default Radium(MyComponent);
