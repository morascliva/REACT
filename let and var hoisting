function hoistingExample() {
  console.log(varHoisted); // Outputs "undefined"
  // console.log(letHoisted); // Throws an error: "ReferenceError: Cannot access 'letHoisted' before initialization"

  var varHoisted = "I am var"; // Hoisted with value "undefined"
  let letHoisted = "I am let"; // Not hoisted
}

hoistingExample();


In this example:

varHoisted is declared using var after the console.log statement. Despite being declared later in the code, the console.log statement does not throw an error and outputs undefined.
This is because variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope with an initial value of undefined.

letHoisted is declared using let after the console.log statement. Attempting to log letHoisted before its declaration results in a "ReferenceError."
Unlike var, variables declared with let are not initialized during hoisting, and trying to access them before they are declared will lead to an error.

This example demonstrates that variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope with an initial value of undefined, 
while variables declared with let are not initialized during hoisting and accessing them before their declaration results in an error. 
This difference in hoisting behavior is one of the reasons why let is often preferred over var in modern JavaScript development.
