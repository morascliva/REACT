function redeclarationExample() {
  var varVariable = "I am var";
  let letVariable = "I am let";

  var varVariable = "I am re-declared var"; // No error, re-declaration
  // let letVariable = "I am re-declared let"; // Throws an error: "SyntaxError: Identifier 'letVariable' has already been declared"
}

redeclarationExample();


In this example:

varVariable is declared using var, and then it is re-declared with a new value using var again.
Unlike let, variables declared with var can be re-declared within the same scope without any errors.
The re-declaration simply updates the value of the existing variable.

letVariable is declared using let, and an attempt is made to re-declare it with a new value using let. 
However, this line of code will throw a "SyntaxError" because variables declared with let cannot be re-declared within the same scope. 
Once a variable is declared with let, you cannot declare another variable with the same name using let in the same scope.

This example demonstrates that variables declared with var can be re-declared within the same scope without causing any issues,
while variables declared with let will throw an error if you attempt to re-declare them within the same scope. This is another aspect where let provides more strict and predictable behavior compared to var.
